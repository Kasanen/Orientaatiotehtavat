1. There are many everyday situations where simulation would be useful. However one thing came in my mind is traffic lights. It could be simulated so that vehicles would move safely. Accident rate could be high if the traffic lights would not be tested or simulated.

2. 
> For instance, if we simulate traffic lights, the variability is seen when pedestrian pushes crossing request button. 

> Complexity is seen in combinatorial complexity for example number of intersections, lgihts, phases, and possible coordination patterns. And dynamic complexity is seen in how traffic flows, queues, delays and pedestrian requests.

> Traffic lights are highly interconnected systems. The lights are interconnected because the green phase for one direction always means a red phase for another.
